# Meeting Agenda
- Share overall project status.
- Do you have feedback on our architecture/software design per the living doc? Feedback on code foundation so far?
- Can you please share your experience with developing map applications? Tips on navigating Google Maps API's limitations on free version?
Thank you, Celestine!

# Project Status
## Goals for this week
- Decide on and set up basic app system and layout. (No big feature implementation yet.)
- Start on basic features like UI.
- Understand how we will make the (front end and back end) code scalable.
  
## Progress and issues
- "Architecture and design" writing.
- Initialized codebase for backend.

## Goals for next week
- Continue setting up code foundation: develop user authentication and API architecture (back end) and UI framework (front end).
- Map integration: integrate API and display on UI.
- Finish "Testing and continuous integration" writing in living doc.
