# Meeting Agenda
- We are considering rolling back our schedule a bit. Setting up backend/frontend is taking more time than initially laid out, so we still need to integrate and display our map on the UI. We may then push our user upload and recommendation tasks to later dates.
- Any tips/specific goals as we polish our 1st major use case for demo (beyond what's in the beta release spec)?
Thank you, Celestine! 

# Project Status
## Goals for this week
- Continue setting up code foundation: develop user authentication and API architecture (back end) and UI framework (front end).
- Map integration: integrate API and display on UI.
- Finish "Testing and continuous integration" writing in living doc.
## Progress and issues
- Backend: 
- Frontend UI progress: Set up framework: Expo with React Native. (Old issue: We don't all have Macs, so could not compile/preview our iOS app. Solution: Use the Expo framework.)
- Map integration issue: We are still working on backend and frontend components separately, so were not ready to integrate them yet. This will stay our next goal.
- Testing and CI progress: Completed setup/written work! 
## Goals for next week
- Map integration: Display map on UI.
- Beta release: Finish implementing core components (map, recommendation system, journal); demo 1 major use case (explore recommendations on the app).
