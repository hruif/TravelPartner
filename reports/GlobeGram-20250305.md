# Project Status
## Goals for this week
- Enable user posting experiences (images, reviews) to database.
- Implement budget and recommendation filters.  
- Learn from the team we are peer reviewing! 
## Progress and issues
- Added feature where users can make a "journal entry"/post including title, description, location, photo, experience type, and cost. Frontend mostly connects to backend. 
- Working on making pictures show up in the map search.
- We found that user appears to stay signed into app, but doesn't keep access to endpoints. We have an issue made for this and a plan to resolve. 
## Goals for next week
- Fine-tune make-an-entry feature, ensuring seamless frontend/backend integration.
- If time, add budget filter to search.
- Address issues made by peer review.
- Prep live demo!
