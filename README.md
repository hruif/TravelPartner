# TravelPartner
(WIP - Missing layout info. Description and goals from living doc, definitely subject to change.)

We are a social travel-planning app. Users planning a trip can be inspired by other travelers’ diaries around that destination, filtering the map according to their budget. Travelers may upload and tag their photos with ease, receive a comprehensive travel diary in return, and share their diary on the map to inspire others. 

# Our Goals
Our target customers are travelers. Our app offers solutions for 2 problems travelers face:

1) When planning a trip, one often doesn’t know all that they want to do nor all that’s available at their destination. Our app will show users other travelers’ photos at nearby spots for inspiration, accompanied with planning information like pricing, etc. 

2) During a trip, days are full of adventure, so there remains little time to preserve these moments’ details in writing, for example. Given photos and tags, our app will return a travel diary. Optionally, users can share these to inspire others.
